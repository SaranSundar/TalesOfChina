  static const exampleChapter = '''Ai, this is a nerve-wracking matter. This kind of thing can’t be written in the memory tree. Otherwise, Zhao Ying will see it. She will think that my thoughts are lecherous. It could inflict the opposite effect instead.


Then, I will start from the first time I entered Zhao Ying’s office and shooed away Jin Gang, who brought the flowers! Thinking of this, Yang Ming’s train of thought gushed out like spring water. He started writing his flowery love story. From the first remedial class to that moonlit night when the two ate noodles together, when they faced the gangsters, the moment when they almost kissed, until the reunion after graduation… The coffee shop talk, and Yang Ming pretending to be her boyfriend…


Yang Ming found that he really had a talent for writing. Thanks to the novels often written by a guy named Fishman II, his level of essay composition had greatly improved.


It was done in one go as though there was a divinity blessing. After Yang Ming finished writing, he carefully rechecked it before he closed the memory tree. Of course, he still left some blanks for Zhao Ying to add.


Yang Ming packed up the things on the table and was ready to leave the study room. The students in the study room were mostly devoted to learning. No one bothered with Yang Ming coming and going. They didn’t even look at him.


Outside the classroom, Yang Ming was also bored, so he just strolled around on campus. As he passed by the teacher faculty building, Yang Ming suddenly thought, Will Xiao Qing be in school?


So he walked into the teacher faculty building to Xiao Qing’s office. Before he came to the office, Yang Ming knocked on the door. Of course, Xiao Qing’s voice came from within, “Please, come in.”


Yang Ming’s heart was filled with joy, It seems that this trip was not wasted . Yang Ming pushed the door and went in. He saw Xiao Qing facing the computer, handling something.


“Sister Xiao Qing!” Yang Ming closed the door and walked quickly to Xiao Qing.


Xiao Qing thought it was a teacher in the department, but she didn’t expect it to be Yang Ming. She suddenly turned around and said, “Yang Ming, why are you here? Your lectures haven’t started yet, right?”


“Yeah, I’m just bored. I came to the school to see a classmate. Her class hasn’t finished yet, so I came here to spend my time. I wanted to see if you came to work.” Yang Ming came to Xiao Qing as he hugged her from behind and whispered.


Xiao Qing’s body trembled. After all, this was in the office, not at home. Every time Yang Ming was intimate with her in the office, she had a very peculiar feeling, which was both intense and exciting. However, this feeling was really wonderful and a bit addictive at the same time.


“Quickly, let go. What if when someone comes in?” Xiao Qing twisted her body and complained.


After Yang Ming heard it, he smiled indifferently. “I’ve locked the door.”


“You’re really playful. If godfather found out about it, wouldn’t he be pissed off?” said Xiao Qing helplessly. The relationship between her and Yang Ming was a pain in Xiao Qing’s heart forever. It couldn’t be made public. She could only be sneaky for a lifetime.


Although she knew Yang Ming first, she seemed to be less than Sun Jie. At the very least, Sun Jie could be with Yang Ming openly without any scruples.


“If it were found out, so be it. We aren’t actually siblings. There is nothing to be afraid of.” Yang Ming didn’t care. “You overthink too much. Life is really simple; you just insist on making it difficult.”


“No matter if it is overthinking or not, I am really afraid of others looking at me with a peculiar gaze…” sighed Xiao Qing.


Yang Ming nodded and expressed his understanding. He also knew what kind of past Xiao Qing had. When she was about to get married, the groom ran away. How ironic was it? If it were another person with poor mental quality, suicide was possible.


Moreover, Yang Ming was the nominal younger brother of Xiao Qing. If he were with Xiao Qing, the outsider would definitely say something unpleasing. Yang Ming didn’t care, but how about Xiao Qing? Yang Ming couldn’t help but be considerate of her.


“I understand. Don’t worry. I will be careful.” Yang Ming said, “Sister Xiao Qing, how are godfather and godmother doing recently?”


Yang Ming had a lot of things in this time frame. Aside from the Chinese New Year visit to Liu Weishan’s home, Yang Ming hadn’t visited and a month had already passed.


“Our godparents’ health is not bad… Just that, it is almost Liu Tianqi’s birthday. Their moods are somewhat down-spirited,” sighed Xiao Qing.


“Liu Tianqi?” Yang Ming was stunned for a while before he suddenly remembered. I think I heard from godfather before that Liu Tianqi is his son . He turned silent all of a sudden. ” Oh yeah , Sister Xiao Qing, can you tell me about the matter with Liu Tianqi? What happened? I noticed that our godparents avoid this topic. I have been afraid to ask questions about it.”


“I knew Brother Liu Tianqi also. We graduated from Song Jiang Industry University. Unlike godfather, Liu Tianqi was interested in bioengineering. At a young age, he was already famous in the bioengineering field. Liu Tianqi’s articles about bacteria had won international awards. He was a dazzling new star in the national bioscience community!” Xiao Qing said, “Moreover, his fiancée was his assistant. She also had quite a reputation in biology. The couple was young, yet they seem to exceed godfather in the academic world. Unfortunately, on the eve of their marriage, both of them disappeared mysteriously at the same time…”


“Mysterious disappearance!” Yang Ming suddenly became inexplicable. Why is it like what happened in the movies? Can people suddenly disappear? Yang Ming said, baffled, “Did anyone report it to the police? Was there any news later?”


“It was reported to the police. When such a well-known scientist is missing, the pressure on the police is also quite large.” Xiao Qing shook his head and continued, “However, despite a lot of police force being used, Liu Tianqi’s whereabouts were not found. He vanished from the face of the earth. There was no news at all. At first, everyone thought it was a kidnapping, but they did not receive any phone calls and messages from the kidnappers. Later, they realized that things were unusual. Even some special departments from the country had participated in the investigation. They even suspected that Liu Tianqi was arrested by hostile foreign forces, but there were no results.”


“This is actually the case…” This was the first time that Yang Ming had heard the whole story. I didn’t expect godfather to have such a powerful son, and he was missing strangely. Even if the old man is strong again, he will still be sad sometimes!


“Yeah, so in these past few years, we have not mentioned this thing in front of godfather. I hope godfather can forget these unpleasant sad past events, but can this kind of thing be forgotten if you try to forget it?” said Xiao Qing. “Every year, on Brother Liu Tianqi’s birthday, godfather will go to the police station again to see if there are any new clues. Although he knows that there is basically no hope, if there is news, the police will inform him the first time, but godfather still is…”


Yang Ming nodded. This kind of feeling of losing loved ones was something that ordinary people couldn’t understand. “I hope that Elder Brother Liu can come back.”


“Well, let us not talk about this. Don’t mention it in front of godfather in the future, so that godfather will not be sad,” said Xiao Qing.


“I understand,” said Yang Ming. “I am not that stupid.”


“If you have time, go back and accompany godfather. Godfather is old. As he accepted you as his godson, it is also a way of comfort.” Xiao Qing said, “Okay, time is almost up. I have a graduate student meeting today and going to leave soon. Aren’t you waiting for your classmate? You may stay in my office. Just lock the door when you go.”


“Alright, go ahead.” Yang Ming nodded. Zhao Ying would definitely call back or reply to the message if she received it. Since there were no messages yet, it meant that she had not gotten out of class.


Xiao Qing cleaned up the things on her desk, then she took out a coat from the closet and put it on. As she changed her clothes, she didn’t avoid Yang Ming. After all, the relationship between the two people could be said to be intimate.


Xiao Qing didn’t mention a word about the day she fooled around with Sun Jie and Yang Ming. Since she didn’t want to say it, Yang Ming wouldn’t bring it up. Yang Ming thought that if Xiao Qing didn’t mention it, she had acquiesced to it. It wouldn’t be great if it were said.


After Xiao Qing left the office, Yang Ming sat in Xiao Qing’s seat. He played with her computer and simply opened QQ, but he saw that there was a QQ number on it with a saved password.


Yang Ming was a bit curious, Would this be Xiao Qing’s QQ number? As Yang Ming thought of it up till this point, he was eager to log in to see who was on Xiao Qing’s QQ. It wasn’t that Yang Ming suspected Xiao Qing, but Yang Ming’s curiosity was tempting him.


Yang Ming clicked on the login, and QQ was quickly logged in. He took a look at the account status. Yang Ming found out that it was online and promptly set himself to be invisible. If someone talked to himself, he couldn’t reply.


However, Yang Ming’s hand was still a step late. ” Didididi ” came from the computer. There was a prompt showing receipt of a new message.


Yang Ming was troubled. He could only open the chat window. The person who spoke was a woman. The online nickname was “Little Jie.”


“Naughty girl, aren’t you working? Why did you open your QQ?” said Little Jie.


Little Jie? Yang Ming was stunned, and he observed her tone talking to Xiao Qing. Is she the fox, Sun Jie? Thinking of Sun Jie’s chest, Yang Ming had a lecherous smile. He clicked on her information and looked it up.


The written information was ordinary and simplistic. There was nothing special, but Yang Ming still found the clues! Little Jie’s e-mail address was actually the pinyin of “sunjie!”


Haha, she really is Sun Jie! After determining her identity, Yang Ming decided to tease her. So, he imitated Xiao Qing’s tone and sent a message over, “I just finished work; feeling exhausted. I just logged in casually to take a look. How about you? You’re a president, yet you still have time to chat online? I switched to invisible the moment I came online, yet I was caught by you.”


After finishing this sentence, Yang Ming stared at the computer screen nervously, waiting for Sun Jie’s reply. To further determine the identity of the other party, Yang Ming tested again.''';
